- **Circulating free DNA** (cfDNA) are DNA fragments released into bloodstream 

- Fraction of cfDNA could be released from cancer or tumor cells are **circulating-tumor DNA** (ctDNA)

- Contains genetic and epigenetic changes, and could reveal the cells from which is originated
  - Identify different types of cancer


:::

::::

::: {.notes}

- ctDNA are like fraction of cfDNA but derived from tumor cells

- Apoptosis and necrosis are main sources of these ctDNA, these are simply two forms of cell death that naturally occurs in the body

:::

## Detection the origin of cfDNA

Current cfDNA screening test can detect presence of abnormal signals but **cannot** tell tumor's origin or cancer type or tissue of origin (TOO)

. . .

- Computation methods use epigenetic markers like **methylation profiles** to deduce origin of cfDNA fragments
  - "Deconvolute" plasma cfDNA composition
  - Varying approach, probabilistic, linear model, matrix factorization, etc. 
  - Most require a reference atlas

. . .

::: {.callout-note}

## Existing methods limiations

- Cannot deconvolute multiple cancer tissues
- Do not account for missing variables due to incompleteness of atlas
- Do not allow full deconvolution of all cfDNA components and estimate cell proportion only

:::

::: {.notes}

- Explain why using these epigentic markers, and why each is important

- Reference atlas consist of either normal tissues or celltype specific methylation marker

- Models could be linear combinations or multimodal analysis or support vector machine, some of them introduce feature selection to remove redundant markers, others use probabilitis model.

Authors developed their own reference-based deconvolution method, **MetDecode**

- Account for missing data by extending reference atlas **on-the-fly** from cfDNA methylation profiles

- Built their own reference atlas of tissue-specific methylation markers for 4 different cancer tissues
  - Breast, ovarian, cervical, and colorectal

## The main deconvolution algorithm

$$
f(A) \quad = \quad \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{k=1}^p \quad W_{ik} \quad \Big| \underbrace{R_{ik}^{\text{(cfdna)}}}_{(1)} - \underbrace{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m A_{ij} B_{jk}}_{(2)}\Big| 
$$

1. Methylation ratios $R^{\text{cfdna}}$
2. Reconstructed matrix, which approximates $(1)$


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Some math behind how MetDecode model this "unknown" contributor

To account unknown contributors in cfDNA mixture by adding $h$ extra rows to $R^{\text{(atlas)}}$

$$
R_{hk}^{\text{(atlas)}} = \begin{cases} R_k^{lb}, \quad e_k > 0 \\ R_k^{ub}, \quad otherwise \end{cases} \quad \text{where} \quad e_k = \text{median}_i \quad \Big( -R_{ik}^{(cfdna)} + \sum\limits_{j} \alpha_{ij} R_{jk}^{(\text{atlas})} \Big)
$$

:::


::: {.notes}

- The unknown contributing part is actually to the atlas
- $e_k > 0$ implies reconstructed cfDNA samples have higher methylation ratios than observed in ùëÖ(cfdna), suggesting missing information in R (atlas)
- lb is lower bound of quantile (0.4, Rk(atlas)), ub is upper bound of quantile (0.6 Rk(atlas))
- These left bound and right bound are calculated by quantiles 
- Alpha represents initial cell type proportion estimates, obtained from non-negative least squares
- $A_{ij}$ is estimated proportion of cell type $j$ to cfDNA profile $i$
- k is a marker region, $R_k$ is k-th column of R(atlas)

## Evaluation metrics

Using 4 Samples of 10 replicates of 12 different tumor fractions in-silico mixtures of tumor gDNA and healthy cfDNA and evaluate:

- Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Mean Sqaured Error to evaluate MetDecode estimations
- Accuracy to evaluate multiclass cancer TOO prediction, and Cohen's kappa to adjust for multiclass nature

## Results

![Cancer type prediction comparisons based on highest cancer contributors](assets/fig/cancer_pred-highlight.png)


- MetDecode with 1 unknown contributor performs best based on Cohen'kappa

- All methods do equally poor for $< 50\%$ accuracy when predicting all samples

- Closer performance when looking at those $19$ samples with tumor fraction $> 3\%$^[This is based on ichorCNA from @adalsteinsson2017scalable]
  - This is its $84.2\%$ accuracy of correct TOO in $16/19$ cancer cases


::: {.notes}

- Highest cancer contributor here has special meaning, given its multicass, author convert the way to see if prediction is normal or one of the TOO. This TOO is determined by taking some normalization, whereas highest is considered the TOO

- So when method estimated all cancer contributor as zero, the predicted class is considered normal, otherwise it is the highest normalized contributor

-  Half of the misclassified samples were classified as ovarian cancers

- These samples were run with another tool ichorCNA which estimates tumor fraction in cell free DNA

- One mucinous ovarian carcinoma (case 45, stage IV) was predicted to have breast cancer tissue as a major cancer contributor. One triple-negative breast cancer sample (case 8, stage I) was misclassified as ovarian.

- Bottom is ground truth

## Conclusion of the authors

abc

## Summary


::: {.callout-tip}

## How could one utilize cfDNA?

cfDNA epigenetic signatures can be used to deduce TOO or cancer type

:::

. . .

MetDecode is an algorithm that estimates contributions and type of cancer in cfDNA sample


- It models unknown contributors not present in the reference atlas

- And accounts for coverage of each marker region to alleviate potential sources of noise


## Limitations and Future Direction

- Limited size of cfDNA samples for different cancer types
  - Total 93 samples, 4 being Cervical, 13 being Ovarian, rest are breast and colorectal

- Another limit

- Deconvoluting and defining the TOO will aid the oncologists in identifying the tumor and direct treatment
  - Specially when invasive examinations and radiological investigation are not ideal
